## Description

TypeScripts is a typing game for all developers, new and experienced alike; where users are able to see their typing skills when typing code. We noticed that a lot of the typing quizes or games didn't offer developer modes where you can type code instead of random words and sentences and sought to provide a solution in the form of TypeSCripts. This being our very first full stack development project, we learned a lot about technical skills and social skills when working in a team.
